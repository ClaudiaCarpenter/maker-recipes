#### Step 1: Wet Ingredients

*Prep: preheat bottom oven on Proof setting, and find a large glass bowl or plastic food container plus a wooden spoon (without a hole in handle).*

- 454g (16oz) water (hot from the tap)
- 1.5t salt (heaping teaspoon)
- 1.25t yeast (instant dry, rounded teaspoon)
- 2T canola oil
- 1T white sugar

Pour water into container, then stir in salt, yeast, oil and sugar (using just the handle of the wooden spoon, not the spoon itself).

#### Step 2: Dry Ingredients

- 305g (2c) whole wheat flour
- 239g (1.5c) all purpose flour
- 1/4c sunflower seeds
- 1/4c pumpkin seeds
- 1/2c rolled oats

Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in order (oats on top), and stir until well combined (again using just the wooden spoon handle).

#### Step 3: Proof (<100°F)

Cover container with plastic wrap and proof in warm oven for 90 minutes.

#### Step 4: Shape

- 0.25c all purpose flour
- 0.25c rolled oats

Punch down dough, shape into a ball within the container, add oats and toss to coat, then add flour and toss to further coat.

#### Step 5: Rise (<100°F)

*Prep: preheat top oven to 400°F (not convection, not fast preheat), and find and grease two loaf pans.*

Dump coated dough into greased loaf pan, cover with other greased loaf pan (inverted on top), and let rise in warm oven for 45 minutes.

#### Step 6: Bake (400°F)

Move still-combined pans to top oven and bake at 400°F for 40 minutes. Remove from oven, take off inverted top pan and let sit for 10 minutes in the bottom pan before removing.
